<h2> Make Waves: </h2>

<p>
This applet simply adds the top wave to the bottom wave and displays
the result below. It also generates the Lissajous figure that starts/stops
the phase drift on Wave B (a.k.a. the animation).  The user is free to change
all wave parameters, however caution is advised to at least meet the Nyquist 
Criteria (i.e. keep the sample rate at lest twice the frequency) or 
absolutely nothing of any consequence will happen.  Also, the sample rates
must be the same for the addition to work properly (I have not yet finished
the sinc interpolation routines), but again there are no consequences.
The user is encouraged to try to find all the different patterns that can be 
generated by simply adding two waves together.  Some of my favorites are:

<p>

<table border>

  <tr>
    <th> Frequency A </th> 
    <th> Frequency B </th> 
    <th> Comment </th>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td align = center> 1, 2, 3, ... </td>
    <td align = center> 1, 2, 3, ... </td>
    <td> Basic. </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td align = center> 1 </td>
    <td align = center> 2.718, 3.1415 </td>
    <td> The more irrational the frequency ratio, the more intricate the 
         Lissajous figure.  Try longer times with these.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td align = center> 10 </td>
    <td align = center> 9 </td>
    <td> Beats. Try other closely spaced frequencies.</td>
  </tr>

</table>

<p>

Changes in amplitude are hidden by the auto scaling of the displays,
but the right ratio should bring them out.  You can also alter the
wave's direction and the animation's speed by changing the Animation
Phase Step.
