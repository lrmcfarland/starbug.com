	    This is a QuickTime demonstration of my spacecraft simulator
	    that I built from parts found around the home. My long term goal
	    is to experiment with different engines,
	    e.g. <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_drive>ion</a>,
	    <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_Specific_Impulse_Magnetoplasma_Rocket>VASMIR</a>,
	    <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_sails>solar
	      sails</a>, plan a trip to Mars and around the moons of
	    Jupiter.

	    The model is built in C++ and uses xml to describe the system I
	    am testing. A bit old school, but I use
	    <a href=http://xerces.apache.org>xerces</a> in a pure C++ model
	    as well as the xml parsers in Qt and python.

	    I also use my
	    <a href=https://github.com/lrmcfarland/CartesianSpace> Cartesian
	      Space python wrappers</a> to make it easy to extract properties
	    of the simulation like spacecraft speed and orbital angular
	    momentum. 
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    In this example I have the earth and moon with four spacecraft in
	    geocentric orbits at several inclinations.

	    The model is fully 3D and displayed here using OpenGL.

	    The user can change their point of view using the same movement
	    keys found in games like world of warcraft.
