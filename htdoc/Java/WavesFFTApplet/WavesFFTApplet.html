<h2> Make Waves with FFTs: </h2>

<p>
This applet simply adds the top wave to the bottom wave and displays
the result below. It also generates the Lissajous figure that starts/stops
the phase drift on Wave B (a.k.a. the animation).  The user is free to change
all wave parameters, however caution is advised to at least meet the Nyquist 
Criteria (i.e. keep the sample rate at lest twice the frequency) or 
absolutely nothing of any consequence will happen.

<p>
Changes in amplitude are hidden by the auto scaling of the displays,
but the right ratio should bring them out.  You can also alter the
wave's direction and the animation's speed by changing the Animation
Phase Step.

Changes in the FFT parameters are independent of each other since they
are generated from the time sampled data for each wave.  If you increase
the fft size and get a blank screen, there might not be enough data to
fill the buffer.  Try increasing the time or sample rate or both.

The FFT is a modified form of the "Numerical Recipes in C" algorithm.  
Errors in conversion are all mine.
