  <h2>Computer Experience</h2>
<p>

	I enjoy creating new tools and making old ones better.  To me
	that means finding the way to use the language to describe the
	problem you are trying to solve that is as clear to the
	machine that runs it as it is to the programmer who comes
	after to maintain and, hopefully, extend it. I believe that
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">test driven  development</a>
	shows the way to make that happen.

	Most of my experiece is with Python and C/C++. I have a good
	working relationship with JavaScript, Java, git, sql languages
	like PostgreSQL and MySQL, and various Unix shell scripts.
	Examples of my code are available in my github repo: <a href="https://github.com/lrmcfarland">GitHub/lrmcfarland</a>.

<p>
	The SilverTail product builds a statistical data model of user
	behavior on a web site and alerts our customers to unusual
	activity as potential network security vulnerabilities. I
	developed a Python tool kit (genlog) to create synthetic
	backgrounds with various statistical distributions of
	behaviors and add bad actor logs to test the efficacy of the
	detection algorithms and measure the performance of the
	system. I am the "data wrangler" for the threats research
	group analyzing archived customer data for potential signal
	sources that can be used in new detection algorithms. I
	created new data visualization techniques to help with this
	analysis. I also wrote an update of our code review bot,
	capthook ii, that works with git web hooks to manage our pull
	request process.
      </p>
<div id="less_details_1" style="display:none">
<p>
	  The threats research group analyzes data collected by our
	  product in our priority log format: compressed text files. I
	  wrote several Python scripts to parse this format into
	  Python data structures that can then insert this into either
	  a normalized relational database like Postgres or a no-SQL
	  database like MongoDB. As a proof of concept, I was also
	  able to show that this could be run under Hadoop, but with
	  some limitations imposed by our original data format.
	</p>
<p>
	  With indexed access to the transaction data, we are able to
	  develop new ideas about what other statistical measures are
	  available and how effectively they can contribute to a
	  potential score, balancing a low false positive rate with a
	  high false negative one. And of course, actual data help
	  develop better synthetic models for validation and testing.
	</p>
<p>
	  I also set up several types of web servers, like a WordPress
	  blog page and a Magento eCommerce server, which we could
	  "attack" with security software. I collected the logs and
	  analyzed the results in our database to see what the profile
	  of this activity looked like in terms of transaction
	  statistics.
	</p>
<p>
	  Capthook ii is a python server I rebuilt using the Tornado
	  web framework. It responds to JSON sent from github's web
	  hooks API to assist in our code review process. Reviewers
	  exchange comments in git hub, but can also have capthook run
	  review scripts like lint. It will also do merge and rebase
	  with autosquash for reviews to make things easier for users
	  new to git. It uses the Jenkins API to verify the continuous
	  build process has validated the head and base of the merge
	  branches as well as post the status and URIs to the results
	  of builds, documenting the review process.
	</p>
<p>
	  Our development environment is Agile, test driven
	  development (TDD), and object oriented (OO). It is mostly in
	  C++ and Python. I also implement algorithms, fix bugs and
	  mentor developers new to Python.

	I created several Python daemons to support CDNetworks
	back-end infrastructure. This included a core library and the
	scripts that use it (a customers daily usage calculator for
	billing and a DNS bind parser). I wrote the CDNetwork's Python
	style guide (a slightly customized version of <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008">PEP8</a>).  I

	IronPort makes a email server appliance. For that, I developed
	the third generation of our Web Based Reputation Service
	(WBRS) product used by our web appliances. I wrote the
	functional and design specs and developed a tool kit of
	Python/MySQL scripts to generate the reputation updates, test
	their efficacy and debug their contents. I have implemented a
	Python based rule weight evaluation utility that applies a
	gradient descent algorithm to our phone home data to find the
	optimal set of rule weights.

	Prior to that led the development of the 2.0 release of our
	Sender Base Reputation Service (SBRS) product, a DNS service
	used by our email appliances.

	When I started at IronPort, I worked on our "corpus", a
	database of spam for use with the IronPort Anti-Spam (IPAS)
	tool.

	For these products, I was responsible for writing the specs,
	code, user's guides and other documentation, coordinating the
	contributions from other engineers, working with QA to develop
	test tools and methodology and resolve the bugs that are
	found.
      </p>
<div id="less_details_3" style="display:none">
<p>
	  For the corpus development, I created a set of rc.subr
	  daemons using Python that processed incoming email from our
	  traps by sending it through our scanning engines and
	  extracting the results for storage in our database,
	  a.k.a. the corpus. IPAS pulls a set of test email from the
	  corpus for nightly scoring to determine an optimal set of
	  rules to be pushed to our customers' IronPort mail servers.
	  As the corpus progressed through its 2.0 release, I led the
	  development effort to hand off the maintenance and further
	  development to our Ukrainian contractors.  I wrote the
	  functional specifications and the user's guides for new
	  developers, QA engineers and system administrators.
	  </p>
<p>
	  My initial work on SBRS was to do the planned re-factoring
	  and prepare the code base for a 2.0 release. I surveyed the
	  code tree, pruned many dead branches (reducing the code line
	  count by 60%), created the user's guides (increasing their
	  line count by 100%) and updated the configuration process
	  to use our newest tools, while preserving the underlying
	  data structures (mostly in the MySQL schema) to reduce
	  risk. Once we were confident that the process was clearly
	  understood, updating the data structure became the focus of
	  the 2.0 release. I worked closely with QA and system
	  administration to provide them with the tools they need to
	  monitor the system and verify it is functioning correctly as
	  well as provide documented procedures about what to do if it
	  is not.

	I implemented a new computational framework for atmospheric
	and surface remote sensing, called CSFSR (Classification of
	Spectral Features in the Solar Radiation), for the Information
	Physics Group. I also worked on extending the Signal
	Processing Environment for Application Development (SPEAD)
	tool kit for the Neuro Engineering Lab.
      </p>
<div id="less_details_4" style="display:none">
<p>
	  The CSFSR is a largely C++ test framework that was used to
	  look for the optimal solution to the most likely mix of
	  gases (O3, O2, CO2, NO2 and H2O) seen in a high spectral
	  resolution satellite image of the earth's surface. It
	  combined solar radiation data with
	  <a href="http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/HITRAN">HITRAN</a>
	  data about how these gases absorb light in the atmosphere
	  and used the standard Fortran
	  program <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DISORT">DISORT</a>
	  to analyze an image. We experimented with several techniques
	  to find the optimal solution, including simulated annealing
	  and gradient descent. I was responsible for implementing the
	  application using equations provided by the physicists in
	  the information group. I also created the C++ wrappers for
	  the Fortran functions in DISORT to link them directly to
	  CSFSR, eliminating the need to parse DISORT's normal text
	  output and greatly increasing the speed of processing.  I
	  also built several test harnesses to validate the accuracy
	  of the model.

<p>
	  The SPEAD tool kit is written using
	  the <a href="http://www.trolltech.com">Qt</a> tool kit.
	  I added several signal processing modules, including

	I joined the SETI Institute to work on Project Phoenix's
	Search System Executive (SSE) for the New Search System
	(NSS), the continuation of the NASA program to observe stars
	within 200 light years for radio signals. I wrote many
	applications to support the observation, from the control
	interface to the telescopes through to the to the database to
	store the results.
      </p>
<div id="less_details_5" style="display:none">
<p>
	  I built on my previous experience with controlling RF
	  equipment using the GPIB bus (IEEE-488) including tuning
	  local oscillators, setting step attenuators and switches,
	  generating test signals and monitoring system status. To
	  simplify configuration and add flexibility and
	  maintainability into how observations were programmed, I
	  created a C++ library of the equipment and wrapped this with
	  <a href="http://www.swig.org">SWIG</a> to create a
	  simple command interface. I turned this into a simple TCP/IP
	  server by using Tcl's socket library to process strings sent
	  to a socket. This allowed a client as simple as telnet to
	  send commands to the server. This also made it easy to use
	  Expect to create a suite of QA regression tests to validate
	  the server.
	</p>
<p>
	  I was also fortunate to have the opportunity to do many
	  things I had not done before. Working mainly from the Rubini
	  Linux Device Drivers book, I wrote the device drivers for
	  two custom PCI boards used to process the signals and
	  monitor status.  I created the MySQL schema and the C++ and
	  Java APIs to store the test input parameters and results of
	  the observation, which included many thousands of signals,
	  all RFI from things like ships radars and cell phones. I
	  also created a Java SWING application to provide a GUI for
	  the database to make it easier for the astronomers to access
	  the data and generate reports.
	</p>
<p>
	  However, the most fun was to participate in the observations
	  with the astronomers at Arecibo and Jodrell Bank. I wrote a
	  common interface to both of the observatory's telescope
	  pointing controls and did on site setup and debugging of our
	  hardware and software.

      </p>
<div id="less_details_8" style="display:none">
<p>
	  The IOT consisted of a suite of tests, often customized to

	  and Linux) by sending commands over custom TCP/IP
	  client-server applications and via the GPIB bus (IEEE-488),

	I started at Lockheed in the electromagnetic compatibility
	(EMC) group running Fortran computer models of how noise gets
	into electronic systems. I developed C applications to first
	analyze the data and then extend the range of the models. I
	finished in the Algorithm Development Group developing a
	signal processing model to show the effect of various signal
	recover techniques.
      </p>
<div id="less_details_9" style="display:none">
<p>
	  My first job at Lockheed was to collect the data for and run
	  an industry standard Fortran computer model (IEMCAP) of cable
	  bundles in spacecraft designs with regard to electromagnetic
	  compatibility (EMC), a.k.a. cross-talk. I used the results
	  of these models to show our flight hardware met the
	  MIL-STD-461 requirements or when it didn't, determine
	  whether it was safe to grant a waiver or not. I was also
	  responsible for observing the hardware test in the EMC
	  lab. Working with Tempest engineers, I developed a new

	  In the Algorithm Development Group, I wrote the X11/Motif
