	I enjoy creating new tools and making old ones better.  To me
	that means finding the way to use the language to describe the
	problem you are trying to solve that is as clear to the
	machine that runs it as it is to the programmer who comes
	after to maintain and, hopefully, extend it. I believe that
	test driven  development
	shows the way to make that happen.
      </p>
<p>
	Most of my experiece is with Python and C/C++. I have a good
	working relationship with JavaScript, Java, git, sql languages
	like PostgreSQL and MySQL, and various Unix shell scripts.
	Examples of my code are available in my github repo: GitHub/lrmcfarland.

	The SilverTail product builds a data model of user behavior on
	a customers web site and alerts them to unusual activity as
	potential network security vulnerabilities.

	To support the development of our model, I built a Python tool
	kit (genlog) to create test data of the types of logs our
	customers generate (Microsoft WinEvents, Cisco VPN and WSA as
	well as our own SilverTail format). The test data sets are
	used to debug the scoring algorithms, test the limits of
	efficacy, measure performance and create demos.

	This tool kit is also used to read customer provided example
	logs to get some insight into the behaviors they are seeing
	and how we can improve our model.

	I also created a productivity tool, capthook, that plugs
	into GitHub's web hooks and facilitates the pull request
	review process by connecting our version control software
	GitHub to our continuous build server, Jenkins, through
	their APIs.

	I created several Python daemons to support CDNetworks

	scripts that use it (a customers daily usage calculator for
	billing and a DNS bind parser). I wrote the CDNetwork's Python
	style guide (a slightly customized version of PEP8).  I
	also documented the design, wrote the user's guides and work
	closely with QA to validate the code worked as intended.

	IronPort makes a email server appliance. For that, I developed
	the third generation of our Web Based Reputation Service
	(WBRS) product used by our web appliances. I wrote the
	functional and design specs and developed a tool kit of
	Python/MySQL scripts to generate the reputation updates, test
	their efficacy and debug their contents. I have implemented a
	Python based rule weight evaluation utility that applies a
	gradient descent algorithm to our phone home data to find the
	optimal set of rule weights.

	Prior to that led the development of the 2.0 release of our
	Sender Base Reputation Service (SBRS) product, a DNS service
	used by our email appliances.

	When I started at IronPort, I worked on our "corpus", a
	database of spam for use with the IronPort Anti-Spam (IPAS)
	tool.

	For these products, I was responsible for writing the specs,
	code, user's guides and other documentation, coordinating the
	contributions from other engineers, working with QA to develop
	test tools and methodology and resolve the bugs that are
	found.
