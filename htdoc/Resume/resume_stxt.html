  <h2>Computer Experience</h2>
<p>
        I am fluent in C/C++, Python, PostgreSQL, MySQL and git. I
        have a good working relationship with Java, Unix shell scripts
        (Bourne and C shell families), make, Tcl/Tk, flex/bison and
        xml. I also have worked successfully with Fortran (largely by
        wrapping it in C++), and Perl in the past.
      </p>
<p>
        My operating system experience is largely with the Unix family
        of BSD, HPUX, Irix, Linux, OSX, and Solaris.

  <h2>Work Experience</h2>
<h3><td>SilverTail Systems (now EMC/RSA)</td></h3>
<p>Research and Development</p>
<p>Principal Software Engineer</p>
<p>November 2011 - present</p>
<p>

	The SilverTail product builds a data model of user activity on
	a web site and alerts our customers to unusual activity as
	potential network security vulnerabilities. I have developed a
	python test kit to create synthetic background and bad actor
	logs to test the accuracy of the detection algorithms. I am
	also the "data wrangler" for the threats research group
	analyzing archived customer data for potential signal sources
	that can be used in new detection algorithms. Our environment
	is fully object oriented (OO) test driven development (TDD)
	and mostly in C++ and python. I am also implement algorithms,
	fix bugs and mentor developers new to python.

      </p>
<h3><td>CDNetworks</td></h3>
<p>Back-end Infrastructure</p>
<p>Sr. Software Engineer</p>
<p>April 2011 - November 2011</p>
<p>
	I created the CDNetwork's python style guide (a slightly
	customized version of PEP8) and
	demonstrated how to apply it to our tasks, including updating
	our nightly billing cron jobs as well as improving our core
	library. I wrote an object oriented DNS bind parser to support
	our zone transfer product and integrated it to our database
	using the GUI's Django models and forms. The OO design made it
	simple to apply our customizations to processing the data and
	adapt to new requirements as they were discovered. I also
	wrote a simple python daemon using the multiprocessor module
	to efficiently parse our log data files into round robin
	databases. This included python scripts to synthesize test
	data for performance measurements on the input and a simple
	daemon to generate the json format required for display on the
	GUI along with a threaded python http server to deliver it. I
	also created simple shell wrappers to manage this. I also documented
	the design, wrote the user's guides and work closely with QA to
	validate the code worked as intended.
      </p>
<h3><td>IronPort Systems (now Cisco Systems)</td></h3>
<p>Security Applications</p>
<p>Software Engineer</p>
<p>April 2005 - April 2011</p>
<p>
        I developed the third generation of our Web Based Reputation
        Service (WBRS) product used by our web appliances. I wrote the
        functional and design specs and developed a tool kit of
        python/MySQL scripts to generate the reputation updates, test
        their efficacy and debug their contents. I have implemented a
        python based rule weight evaluation utility that applies a
        gradient descent algorithm to our phone home data to find the
        optimal set of rule weights.

        Prior to that lead the development of the 2.0 release of our
        Sender Base Reputation Service (SBRS) product, a DNS service
        used by our email appliances.

        When I started at IronPort, I worked on our "corpus", a
        database of spam for use with the IronPort Anti-Spam (IPAS)
        tool.

        For these products, I was responsible for writing the specs,
        code, user's guides and other documentation, coordinating the
        contributions from other engineers, working with QA to develop
        test tools and methodology and resolve the bugs that are
        found.

<h3><td>The QSS Group at NASA Ames</td></h3>
<p>Information Physics Group</p>
<p>Sr. Software Engineer</p>
<p>September 2003 - March 2005</p>
<p>
	I implemented a new computational framework for atmospheric
	and surface remote sensing, called CSFSR (Classification of
	Spectral Features in the Solar Radiation), for the Information
	Physics Group. I also worked on extending the Signal
	Processing Environment for Application Development (SPEAD)
	tool kit for the Neuro Engineering Lab.
      </p>
<h3><td>The SETI Institute</td></h3>
<p>The Phoenix Group</p>
<p>Sr. Software Engineer</p>
<p>August 2000 - August 2003</p>
<p>
	I joined the SETI Institute to work on Project Phoenix's
	Search System Executive (SSE) for the New Search System
	(NSS), the continuation of the NASA program to observe stars
	with in 200 light years for radio signals. I wrote many
	applications to support the observation, from the control
	interface to the telescopes through to the to the database to
	store the results.
      </p>
<h3><td>Frequency Technology (now Sequence Design)</td></h3>
<p>Engineering</p>
<p>Sr. Software Engineer</p>
<p>August 1998 - August 2000</p>
<p>
	At Frequency Technology I worked on the Columbus product, a
	tool for creating a SPICE model of the parasitic capacitance
	in the interconnect circuits of integrated circuit designs. I
	developed several ports of the source code base from Solaris
	to HPUX and IRIX platforms updating the build infrastructure
	using Rogue Wave's implementation of the C++ STL.
      </p>
<h3><td>Cadence Design</td></h3>
<p>Multimedia Group</p>
<p>Member of Consulting Staff</p>
<p>October 1996 - June 1998</p>
<p>
	As a member of the multimedia group, I developed several
	modules, in C++, for our Signal Processing Workbench (SPW)
	product, a graphical tool kit for constructing models of
	signal processing systems. I also provided documentation and
	customer support for installing and running the new modules.
      </p>
<h3><td>Trimble Navigation</td></h3>
<p>Land Survey</p>
<p>Member of Technical Staff III</p>
<p>August 1996 - October 1996</p>

	Rational Rose for the TrimTalk communication product.
      </p>
<h3><td>TIW Systems (Now Vertex RSI)</td></h3>
<p>Engineering</p>
<p>Sr. Software Engineer</p>
<p>January 1994 - August 1996</p>
<p>
	At TIW, I developed the software (C++/Tcl on Unix) for our
	in-orbit test (IOT) system of satellite transponders. I was
	also responsible for installing and verifying the equipment at
	the customers facilities (in China, Italy, Luxembourg,
	Virginia and Wyoming).
      </p>
<h3><td>Lockheed Missiles and Space Company (Now Lockheed Martin)</td></h3>
<p>Algorithm Development Group</p>
<p>Sr. Research Engineer</p>
<p>May 1986 - January 1994</p>
<p>
	I started at Lockheed in the electromagnetic compatibility
	(EMC) group running Fortran computer models of how noise gets
	into electronic systems. I developed C applications to first
	analyze the data and then extend the range of the models. I
	finished in the Algorithm Development Group developing a
	signal processing model to show the effect of various signal
	recover techniques.
      </p>
<h3><td>Energy Auditor and Retrofitter (now Home Energy)</td></h3>
<p></p>
<p>Contributing Editor</p>
