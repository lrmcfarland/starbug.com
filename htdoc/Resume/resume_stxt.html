        I am fluent in C/C++, Python, PostgreSQL, MySQL and git. I
        have a good working relationship with Java, Unix shell scripts
        (Bourne and C shell families), make, Tcl/Tk, flex/bison and
        xml. I also have worked successfully with Fortran (largely by
        wrapping it in C++), and Perl in the past. I have examples of
        my code on GitHub/lrmcfarland.
        My operating system experience is largely with the Unix family
        of BSD, HPUX, Irix, Linux, OSX, and Solaris.

	The SilverTail product builds a statistical data model of user
	activity on a web site and alerts our customers to unusual
	activity as potential network security vulnerabilities. I have
	developed a python test kit to create synthetic background and
	bad actor logs to test the efficacy of the detection
	algorithms. I am also the "data wrangler" for the threats
	research group analyzing archived customer data for potential
	signal sources that can be used in new detection
	algorithms. Our environment is fully object oriented (OO) test
	driven development (TDD) and mostly in C++ and python. I am
	also implement algorithms, fix bugs and mentor developers new
	to python.

	I created the CDNetwork's python style guide (a slightly
	customized version of PEP8) and
	demonstrated how to apply it to our tasks, including updating
	our nightly billing cron jobs as well as improving our core
	library. I wrote an object oriented DNS bind parser to support
	our zone transfer product and integrated it to our database
	using the GUI's Django models and forms. The OO design made it
	simple to apply our customizations to processing the data and
	adapt to new requirements as they were discovered. I also
	wrote a simple python daemon using the multiprocessor module
	to efficiently parse our log data files into round robin
	databases. This included python scripts to synthesize test
	data for performance measurements on the input and a simple
	daemon to generate the json format required for display on the
	GUI along with a threaded python http server to deliver it. I
	also created simple shell wrappers to manage this. I also documented
	the design, wrote the user's guides and work closely with QA to
	validate the code worked as intended.

        I developed the third generation of our Web Based Reputation
        Service (WBRS) product used by our web appliances. I wrote the
        functional and design specs and developed a tool kit of
        python/MySQL scripts to generate the reputation updates, test
        their efficacy and debug their contents. I have implemented a
        python based rule weight evaluation utility that applies a
        gradient descent algorithm to our phone home data to find the
        optimal set of rule weights.

        Prior to that lead the development of the 2.0 release of our
        Sender Base Reputation Service (SBRS) product, a DNS service
        used by our email appliances.

        When I started at IronPort, I worked on our "corpus", a
        database of spam for use with the IronPort Anti-Spam (IPAS)
        tool.

        For these products, I was responsible for writing the specs,
        code, user's guides and other documentation, coordinating the
        contributions from other engineers, working with QA to develop
        test tools and methodology and resolve the bugs that are
        found.
