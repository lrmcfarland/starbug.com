  <h2>Computer Experience</h2>
<p>
        I am fluent in C/C++, Python, and MySQL and have a good
        working relationship with Java, Unix shell scripts (Bourne and
        C shell families), make, Tcl/Tk, flex/bison and xml. I also
        have worked successfully with Fortran (largely by wrapping it
        in C++), and Perl in the past.
      </p>
<p>
        My operating system experience is largely with the Unix family
        of BSD, HPUX, Irix, Linux, OSX, and Solaris.
      </p>

  <h2>Work Experience</h2>
<h3><td>SilverTail Systems</td></h3>
<p>Research and Development</p>
<p>Principal Software Engineer</p>
<p>November 2011 - present</p>
<p>
	I developed a python tool kit to analyze customer data and
	generate test data for algorithm development and verification.
	I used same to load log data into a relational database
	(PostgreSQL) to speed analysis.
      </p>
<h3><td>CDNetworks</td></h3>
<p>Back-end Infrastructure</p>
<p>Sr. Software Engineer</p>
<p>April 2011 - November 2011</p>
<p>
	I created the CDNetwork's python style guide (a slightly
	customized version of PEP8) and
	demonstrated how to apply it to our tasks, including updating
	our nightly billing cron jobs as well as improving our core
	library. I wrote an object oriented DNS bind parser to support
	our zone transfer product and integrated it to our database
	using the GUI's Django models and forms. The OO design made it
	simple to apply our customizations to processing the data and
	adapt to new requirements as they were discovered. I also
	wrote a simple python daemon using the multiprocessor module
	to efficiently parse our log data files into round robin
	databases. This included python scripts to synthesize test
	data for performance measurements on the input and a simple
	daemon to generate the json format required for display on the
	GUI along with a threaded python http server to deliver it. I
	also created simple shell wrappers to manage this. I also documented
	the design, wrote the user's guides and work closely with QA to
	validate the code worked as intended.
      </p>
<h3><td>IronPort Systems (now Cisco Systems)</td></h3>
<p>Security Applications</p>
<p>Software Engineer</p>
<p>April 2005 - April 2011</p>
<p>
        I developed the third generation of our Web Based Reputation
        Service (WBRS) product used by our web appliances. I wrote the
        functional and design specs and developed a tool kit of
        python/MySQL scripts to generate the reputation updates, test
        their efficacy and debug their contents. I have implemented a
        python based rule weight evaluation utility that applies a
        gradient descent algorithm to our phone home data to find the
        optimal set of rule weights.

        Prior to that lead the development of the 2.0 release of our
        Sender Base Reputation Service (SBRS) product, a DNS service
        used by our email appliances.

        When I started at IronPort, I worked on our "corpus", a
        database of spam for use with the IronPort Anti-Spam (IPAS)
        tool.

        For these products, I was responsible for writing the specs,
        code, user's guides and other documentation, coordinating the
        contributions from other engineers, working with QA to develop
        test tools and methodology and resolve the bugs that are
        found.
      </p>
<p>
          For the corpus development, I created a set of rc.subr
          daemons using python that processed incoming email from our
          traps by sending it through our scanning engines and
          extracting the results for storage in our database,
          a.k.a. the corpus. IPAS pulls a set of test email from the
          corpus for nightly scoring to determine an optimal set of
          rules to be pushed to our customer's IronPort mail servers.
          As the corpus progressed through its 2.0 release, I lead the
          development effort to hand off the maintenance and further
          development to our Ukrainian contractors.  I wrote the
          functional specifications and the user's guides for new
          developers, QA engineers and system administrators.
          </p>
<p>
	  My initial work on SBRS was to do the planned re-factoring
	  and prepare the code base for a 2.0 release. I surveyed the
	  code tree, pruned many dead branches (reducing the code line
	  count by 60%), created the user's guides (increasing their
	  line count by 100%) and updated the configuration process
	  to use our newest tools, while preserving the underlying
	  data structures (mostly in the MySQL schema) to reduce
	  risk. Once we were confident that the process was clearly
	  understood, updating the data structure became the focus of
	  the 2.0 release. I worked closely with QA and system
	  administration to provide them with the tools they need to
	  monitor the system and verify it is functioning correctly as
	  well as provide documented procedures about what to do if it
	  is not.
        </p>
<h3><td>The QSS Group at NASA Ames</td></h3>
<p>Information Physics Group</p>
<p>Sr. Software Engineer</p>
<p>September 2003 - March 2005</p>
<p>
	I implemented a new computational framework for atmospheric
	and surface remote sensing, called CSFSR (Classification of
	Spectral Features in the Solar Radiation), for the Information
	Physics Group. I also worked on extending the Signal
	Processing Environment for Application Development (SPEAD)
	tool kit for the Neuro Engineering Lab.
      </p>
<p>
	  The CSFSR is a largely C++ test framework that was used to
	  look for the optimal solution to the most likely mix of
	  gases (O3, O2, CO2, NO2 and H2O) seen in a high spectral
	  resolution satellite image of the earths surface. It
	  combined solar radiation data with
	  HITRAN
	  data about how these gases absorb light in the atmosphere
	  and used the standard Fortran
	  program DISORT
	  to analyze an image. We experimented with several techniques
	  to find the optimal solution, including simulated annealing
	  and gradient decent. I was responsible for implemented the
	  application using equations provided by the physicists in
	  the information group. I also created the C++ wrappers for
	  the Fortran functions in DISORT to link them directly to
	  CSFSR, eliminating the need to parse DISORT's normal text
	  output and greatly increasing the speed of processing.  I
	  also built several test harnesses to validate the accuracy
	  of the model.
	</p>
<p>
	  The SPEAD tool kit is written using
	  the Qt tool kit.
	  I added several signal processing modules, including
	  simulators of a simple sine wave signal generator and mixer
	  along with a spectrum analyzer and oscilloscope. I also
	  created a qmake file builder language along with a python
	  script to process it for generating the makefiles needed by
	  Qt to build SPEAD.
	</p>
<h3><td>The SETI Institute</td></h3>
<p>The Phoenix Group</p>
<p>Sr. Software Engineer</p>
<p>August 2000 - August 2003</p>
<p>
	I joined the SETI Institute to work on Project Phoenix's
	Search System Executive (SSE) for the New Search System
	(NSS), the continuation of the NASA program to observe stars
	with in 200 light years for radio signals. I wrote many
	applications to support the observation, from the control
	interface to the telescopes through to the to the database to
	store the results.
      </p>
<p>
	  I built on my previous experience with controlling RF
	  equipment using the GPIB bus (IEEE-488) including tuning
	  local oscillators, setting step attenuators and switches,
	  generating test signals and monitoring system status. To
	  simplify configuration and add flexibility and
	  maintainability into how observations were programmed, I
	  created a created a C++ library of the equipment and wrapped
	  this with SWIG to
	  create a simple command interface. I turned this into a
	  simple TCP/IP server by using Tcl's socket library to
	  process strings sent to a socket. This allowed a client as
	  simple as telnet to send commands to the server. This also
	  made it easy to use Expect to create a suite of QA
	  regression tests to validate the server.
	</p>
<p>
	  I was also fortunate to have the opportunity to do many
	  things I had not done before. Working mainly from the Rubini
	  Linux Device Drivers book, I wrote the device drivers for
	  two custom PCI boards used to process the signals and
	  monitor status.  I created the MySQL schema and the C++ and
	  Java APIs to store the test input parameters and results of
	  the observation, which included many thousands of signals,
	  all RFI from things like ships radars and cell phones. I
	  also created a Java SWING application to provide a GUI for
	  the database to make it easier for the astronomers to access
	  the data and generate reports.
	</p>
<p>
	  However, the most fun was to participate in the observations
	  with the astronomers at Arecibo and Jodrell Bank. I wrote a
	  common interface to both of the observatory's telescope
	  pointing controls and did on site setup and debugging of our
	  hardware and software.
	</p>
<p>
	</p>
<h3><td>Frequency Technology (now Sequence Design)</td></h3>
<p>Engineering</p>
<p>Sr. Software Engineer</p>
<p>August 1998 - August 2000</p>
<p>
	At Frequency Technology I worked on the Columbus product, a
	tool for creating a SPICE model of the parasitic capacitance
	in the interconnect circuits of integrated circuit designs. I
	developed several ports of the source code base from Solaris
	to HPUX and IRIX platforms updating the build infrastructure
	using Rogue Wave's implementation of the C++ STL.
      </p>
<p>
	  I researched how changes to the mathematics of the model
	  would affect the results, creating several special purpose
	  software tools to accomplish this.  I wrote an C++ parser to
	  allow Columbus to parse hierarchical SPICE decks and
	  developed a command line option object to simplify setting
	  and accessing configuration information. I also re-factored
	  our Perl build scripts to support builds on the HPUX and
	  IRIX platforms.
        </p>
<h3><td>Cadence Design</td></h3>
<p>Multimedia Group</p>
<p>Member of Consulting Staff</p>
<p>October 1996 - June 1998</p>
<p>
	As a member of the multimedia group, I developed several
	modules, in C++, for our Signal Processing Workbench (SPW)
	product, a graphical tool kit for constructing models of
	signal processing systems. I also provided documentation and
	customer support for installing and running the new modules.
      </p>
<p>
	  The modules were part of a custom model built for Fujitsu of
	  their JSAT MPEG-2 decoder. These included interfaces to load
	  video data to and from disk files, modules for mixing on
	  screen display information into the video stream using the
	  vertical blanking interval as well as modules to model an
	  asynchronous serial bus and a IC card reader.
	</p>
<h3><td>Trimble Navigation</td></h3>
<p>Land Survey</p>
<p>Member of Technical Staff III</p>
<p>August 1996 - October 1996</p>
<p>
	I wrote makefiles to build the source code generated by
	Rational Rose for the TrimTalk communication product.
      </p>
<h3><td>TIW Systems (Now Vertex RSI)</td></h3>
<p>Engineering</p>
<p>Sr. Software Engineer</p>
<p>January 1994 - August 1996</p>
<p>
	At TIW, I developed the software (C++/Tcl on Unix) for our
	in-orbit test (IOT) system of satellite transponders. I was
	also responsible for installing and verifying the equipment at
	the customers facilities (in China, Italy, Luxembourg,
	Virginia and Wyoming).
      </p>
<p>
	  The IOT consisted of a suite of tests, often customized to
	  meet customer specific requirements, that measured the
	  performance of a transponder once the satellite was in its
	  working orbit. These tests ran on a Unix work station (HPUX
	  and Linux) by sending commands over custom TCP/IP
	  client-server applications and via the GPIB bus (IEEE-488),
	  to signal generators. The return signal was measured with a
	  spectrum analyzer or RF power meter and the results were
	  stored in a relational database. I developed a C++ library
	  for the instruments we used which allowed us to mix and
	  match hardware to quickly address customer customizations.
	  I also wrote the schema for the database tables.
	</p>
<p>
	  The test were used on SES Astra's 1D, ChinaSat's DFH-3 and
	  EchoStar's EchoStar1 satellites. They measured the satellite
	  transponder's local oscillator, equivalent isotropically
	  radiated power (EIRP), saturation curve, frequency response,
	  G/T, spurious emissions, and inter-modulation
	  characteristics to name a few.
	</p>
<h3><td>Lockheed Missiles and Space Company (Now Lockheed Martin)</td></h3>
<p>Algorithm Development Group</p>
<p>Sr. Research Engineer</p>
<p>May 1986 - January 1994</p>
<p>
	I started at Lockheed in the electromagnetic compatibility
	(EMC) group running Fortran computer models of how noise gets
	into electronic systems. I developed C applications to first
	analyze the data and then extend the range of the models. I
	finished in the Algorithm Development Group developing a
	signal processing model to show the effect of various signal
	recover techniques.
      </p>
<p>
	  My first job at Lockheed was to collect the data for and run
	  a industry standard Fortran computer model (IEMCAP) of cable
	  bundles in spacecraft designs with regard to electromagnetic
	  compatibility (EMC), a.k.a. cross-talk. I used the results
	  of these models to show our flight hardware met the
	  MIL-STD-461 requirements or when it didn't, determine
	  whether it was safe to grant a waver or not. I was also
	  responsible for observing the hardware test in the EMC
	  lab. Working with Tempest engineers, I developed a new
	  application in C, based on a set of equations in an IEEE
	  paper that would allow the model to calculate the cross talk
	  at the much higher frequency requirements of Tempest.
	</p>
<p>
	  In the Algorithm Development Group, I wrote the X11/Motif
	  GUI for our signal processing tool kit (CWID). I also
	  implemented many of signal processing algorithms. This
	  application served as a test bed for developing new
	  techniques in continuous wave applications, interference
	  rejection, peak detection. After leaving LMSC, I continued
	  to develop signal processing tools like the java applets on
	  my web page (www.starbug.com.
	  See
	  DSP made simple and
	  Make Waves with FFTs).
	  I also received hands on experience with the signal
	  generators, spectrum analyzers and oscilloscopes in our lab.
	</p>
<h3><td>Energy Auditor and Retrofitter (now Home Energy)</td></h3>
<p></p>
<p>Contributing Editor</p>
<p>January 1984 - May 1986</p>
<p>
	I was responsible for producing articles on various aspects of
	energy conservation in residential housing. This included
	researching the topic, interviewing people involved with the
	technology, writing the article and preparing the magazine for
	publication and distribution.
      </p>
<p>
	  I was involved getting the magazine started working on
	  everything from figuring out how to use nroff to do our type
	  setting, to building a database of subscribers and writing
	  the excel macros to print labels for mass mailings. I wrote
	  articles on energy conservation included the advantages of
	  compact fluorescent light bulbs and the results of
	  calorimeter measurements I did on the efficiency microwave
	  ovens to name two. I presented a paper on desk-top
	  publishing at the 1986 ACEEE conference. I also worked as a
	  teaching assistant for Energy and Resources Physics class at
	  U.C. Berkeley.
