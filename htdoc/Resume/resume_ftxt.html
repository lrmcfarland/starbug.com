        I developed the third generation of our Web Based Reputation
        Service (WBRS) product used by our web appliances. I wrote the
        functional and design specs and developed a tool kit of
        python/MySQL scripts to generate the reputation updates, test
        their efficacy and debug their contents. I have implemented a
        python based rule weight evaluation utility that applies a
        gradient descent algorithm to our phone home data to find the
        optimal set of rule weights.

        Prior to that lead the development of the 2.0 release of our
        Sender Base Reputation Service (SBRS) product, a DNS service
        used by our email appliances.

        When I started at IronPort, I worked on our "corpus", a
        database of spam for use with the IronPort Anti-Spam (IPAS)
        tool.

        For these products, I was responsible for writing the specs,
        code, user's guides and other documentation, coordinating the
        contributions from other engineers, working with QA to develop
        test tools and methodology and resolve the bugs that are
        found.

          For the corpus development, I created a set of rc.subr
          daemons using python that processed incoming email from our
          traps by sending it through our scanning engines and
          extracting the results for storage in our database,
          a.k.a. the corpus. IPAS pulls a set of test email from the
          corpus for nightly scoring to determine an optimal set of
          rules to be pushed to our customer's IronPort mail servers.
          As the corpus progressed through its 2.0 release, I lead the
          development effort to hand off the maintenance and further
          development to our Ukrainian contractors.  I wrote the
          functional specifications and the user's guides for new
          developers, QA engineers and system administrators.

	  My initial work on SBRS was to do the planned re-factoring
	  and prepare the code base for a 2.0 release. I surveyed the
	  code tree, pruned many dead branches (reducing the code line
	  count by 60%), created the user's guides (increasing their
	  line count by 100%) and updated the configuration process
	  to use our newest tools, while preserving the underlying
	  data structures (mostly in the MySQL schema) to reduce
	  risk. Once we were confident that the process was clearly
	  understood, updating the data structure became the focus of
	  the 2.0 release. I worked closely with QA and system
	  administration to provide them with the tools they need to
	  monitor the system and verify it is functioning correctly as
	  well as provide documented procedures about what to do if it
	  is not.
