	  My goal in writing my resume this way was to make it more
	  dynamic with urls and graphics. I also wanted to have short
	  and long text versions along with more complex html and
	  Java-script ones. Like a program reusing code, I wanted to
	  "import" one basic document have the different versions
	  generated from it. This would provide a project for me
	  to learn how to use
	  <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML>XML</a> to do this.

	  I also created a
	  <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Type_Definition>DTD</a>
	  to validate the information is in the format I support
	  (should anyone else want to use my format) along with
	  several <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XSLT> XSLT</a>
	  scripts to do the formatting.

      <tr>

	  Initially I used the DTD ENTITY to import the source xml
	  file directly into my xsl scripts, but found that while
	  Safari, Chrome and IE are ok with reading the xml/xslt's
	  external (from the server's point of view) entities, Firefox
	  was not
	  (see <a href=https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=204102>Mozilla
	  bug 204102</a>).  So I use:
	  <code>
	    <pre>  xsltproc cv2html_js.xsl cv.xml > resume_js.html</pre>
	  </code>
	  to create the html file "manually".
	  All the browsers seem happy with that.

	  I am looking into other ways to do this, e.g.
	  <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XInclude>XInclude</a>.
