	  I use the
	  <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML>eXtensible Markup
	    Language (xml)</a> to create a data format to contain my resume
	  information. I did this for the most part to learn what I can do
	  with xml. So along with the resume data, I created a
	  <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Type_Definition>Document
	    Type Definition (DTD)</a> to validate the information is in the
	  format I support (should anyone else want to use my format)
	  along with several
	  <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XSLT>eXtensible Stylesheet
	    Language Transformations (xslt)</a>. I used the DTD ENTITY to
	  create the long, short, javascript (which combines the long and
	  short features by using buttons the user can toggle) and text
	  version by importing the base xml resume data and combining it
	  with different xslts to get the various forms I want from the
	  same data.

	  Along the way I found that while Safari, Chrome and Internet
	  Explorer are fine with this, Firefox is not (see
	  <a href=https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=204102>Mozilla
	    bug 204102</a>). Given this bug is nearly 10 years old now, I am
	  looking for other ways to do this like
	  <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XInclude>XInclude</a>.
	  Until then, I use:
	  <code>
	    <pre>  xsltproc cv2html_js.xsl cv.xml > resume_js.html</pre>
	  </code> 

	  to create the html file from the xml and xslt
	  files on the server side. All the browsers seem happy with
	  that, so it is the first link on this list.
