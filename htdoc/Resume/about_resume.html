	  My goal in writing my resume this way was to have it be both
	  long and short. The more/less buttons were an obvious way to
	  accomplish that. I also wanted to have short and long text
	  versions. I figured I could use the
	  <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML>eXtensible Mark-up
	  Language (XML)</a> to create a data format to contain my
	  information and create style sheets to generate the
	  Java-script, short and long form displays. This would also
	  provide a project for me to learn how to use XML to do this.

	</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
	<td>
	  I created a
	  <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Type_Definition>Document
	  Type Definition (DTD)</a> to validate the information is in
	  the format I support (should anyone else want to use my
	  format) along with several
	  <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XSLT>eXtensible
	  Style-sheet Language Transformations (xslt)</a>. I used the
	  DTD ENTITY to create the long, short, Java-script (which
	  combines the long and short features by using buttons the
	  user can toggle) and text version by importing the base xml
	  resume data and combining it with different xslts to get the
	  different display formats I want from the same data. That is
	  to say, I can update it in one place and have it output all
	  the different formats I want.
	</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
	<td>
	  Along the way I found that while Safari, Chrome and IE can
	  read the xml/xslt's external (from the server's point of view)
	  entities, Firefox does not
	  (see<a href=https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=204102>Mozilla
	  bug 204102</a>).
	  So I use:
	  <code>
	    <pre>  xsltproc cv2html_js.xsl cv.xml > resume_js.html</pre>
	  </code> to create the html file from the XML and xslt
	  files. All the browsers seem happy with that.

	  I am looking into other ways to do this like
	  <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XInclude>XInclude</a>.
