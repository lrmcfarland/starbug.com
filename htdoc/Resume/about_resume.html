    <p>
      The resumes presented here were started back in the days when
      web pages were little more than resumes and links to same. My
      original intent was to use the web resume itself as a way to
      demonstrate my skill at programming. To that end, I am 'kicking
      it old school' and everything on these pages has been created
      'by hand' using only emacs.

    <p>
      In this version, I use the
      <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML>eXtensible Markup
      Language (xml)</a> to create a data format to contain my resume
      information. I did this for the most part to learn what I can do
      with xml. So along with the resume data, I created a
      <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Type_Definition>Document
      Type Definition (DTD)</a> to validate the information is in the
      format I support (should anyone else want to use my format)
      along with several
      <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XSLT>eXtensible Stylesheet
      Language Transformations (xslt)</a>. I used the DTD ENTITY to
      create the long, short, javascript (which combines the long and
      short features by using buttons the user can toggle) and text
      version by importing the base xml resume data and combining it
      with different xslts to get the various forms I want from the
      same data.

      Along the way I found that while Safari, Chrome and Internet
      Explorer are fine with this, Firefox is not (see
      <a href=https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=204102>Mozilla
      bug 204102</a>). Given this bug is nearly 10 years old now, I am
      looking for other ways to do this like
      <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XInclude>XInclude</a>.
      Until then, I used:</p>
      <code>
	<pre>  xsltproc cv2html_js.xsl cv.xml > resume_js.html</pre>
      </code> 
     <p>to create the html file from the xml and xslt
      files on the server side. All the browsers seem happy with
      that, so it is the first link on this list. If you have some
      insight into this, please feel free to let me know what you
      think.
