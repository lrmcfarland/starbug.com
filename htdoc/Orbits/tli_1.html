      This is a QuickTime example of four space craft. Blue and green
      are in geosynchronous orbits. Red and orange started at the same
      altitude, but have almost enough
      energy to make it to the moon, a.k.a. Trans Lunar Injection
      (TLI). Red is close enough to get a gravitational assist that
      throws it out of the earth-moon system.

      stage</a> is known to wander like this.
