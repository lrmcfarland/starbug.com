      Orbits is a planets and spacecraft simulator I built using parts found
      around the home. It is a software project I developed as a test bed to
      sharpen my C++ skills and learn new programming techniques.
      It started with a library of C++ objects,
      <a href=http://www.starbug.com/CPPwrappedPython/cpp_wrapped_python.html>space</a>
      and body, where I apply
      <a href=http://www.google.com/products/catalog?client=safari&rls=en&q=effective+c%2B%2B&oe=UTF-8&um=1&ie=UTF-8&tbm=shop&cid=9356467597289518454&sa=X&ei=TeCRTueOBIadOtaxzL0B&ved=0CDwQ8wIwAw#ps-sellers>Scott
      Meyers' Effective C++</a> 'preferences' as much as
      possible. Initially I used <a href=http://www.swig.org>SWIG</a>
      to wrap my objects in Tcl to let me
      <a href=apollo11.html>script missions</a> and used Tk as a
      simple GUI.  Later I used
      <a href=http://qt.nokia.com/products/>Qt</a> to create an OpenGL
      version and used XML to describe the initial conditions of my
      N-body simulation. I am currently working on
      <a href=http://www.starbug.com/CPPwrappedPython/cpp_wrapped_python.html>wrapping
      my C++ library in python</a> to allow easy access to the orbital
      element vectors so I can plot things like how the angular
      momentum is changing during the gravitational assists or what
      the orbits around
      <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_point>Lagrange
      points</a> look like when centered on their point of view.

      I am still working on my understanding of how to embeded
      QuickTime and Flash in html, so this may not work with your
      browser. At this time, I have had some success with Safari and
      FireFox using QuickTime.

      This is a QuickTime example of four space craft in
      geosynchronous orbit.  All bodies are specified in the xml
      file. The point of view is controlled by the keyboard and
      direction of view by the mouse using the same convention as in
      World of Warcraft.
