      This is a demonstration of my space craft simulator that I built from parts found around the home.

      The model is built in C++ and uses xml to describe the system I
      am testing. A bit old school, but I use
      <a href=http://xerces.apache.org>xerces</a> in a pure C++ model
      as well as the xml parsers in Qt and python.

      I also use my
      <a href=https://github.com/lrmcfarland/CartesianSpace> Cartesian
      Space python wrappers</a> to make it easy to extract properties
      of the simulation like space craft speed and orbital angular
      momentum. 

    </p>

    <p>
      In this example I have the earth and moon with four space craft in
      geocentric orbits at several inclinations.

      The model is fully 3D and displayed here using OpenGL.

      The user can change their point of view using the same movement
      keys found in games like world of warcraft.
