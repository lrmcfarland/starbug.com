# Starbug.com

This is the repo for the starbug.com web site.

It is built on the [nginx docker
container](https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx)
[modified](Dockerfile.nginx.letsencrypt) to include letsencrypt and
starbug.com content.

[Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/) is configured to act as a [TLS
endpoint](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security)
and [reverse proxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_proxy) for
the [starbug astronomy micro-service](https://aai.starbug.com) and
[starbug mongodb database](https://db.starbug.com).

In addition to being a good idea, the TLS transport is necessary to
allow the client to safely send the user's geolocation data for use
with the starbug.com astronomy applications, like finding the [sun's
position](https://aai.starbug.com/solar_azimuth_map) relative to the
user's location at a give time.


Cronjobs are used for maintaining the
[letsencrypt](https://letsencrypt.org) certs with regular
[certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/) renewals and rotating the
logs. The configuration for these are located in [conf](./conf) and
setup in
[Dockerfile.nginx.letsencrypt](./Dockerfile.nginx.letsencrypt) and
[Dockerfile.nginx.selfsigned](./Dockerfile.nginx.selfsigned)


# To Install

Clone this repo from GitHub and run docker to build the containers.

This part is still small enough to be done "by hand", but
I am working on using a deployment tool like Kuberneties
or OpenShift to automate that too.

## one time setup

### storage

To support letsencrypt renewals I added two docker volumes for
persistent storage: well-known for the challenge result mounted on
/opt/starbug/www/.well-known and letsencrypt configuration on
/etc/letsencrypt. These are the default locations for cerbot to
operate. I also created a starbugbackup volume for backups.

```
    docker volume create starbuglogs
    docker volume create letsencrypt
    docker volume create wellknown
    docker volume create starbugbackup

```

### create a network

The containers communicate on docker's internal network

```
   docker network create starbugnet

```


# To Build

There are several docker files to build different configurations.
[Dockerfile.nginx.letsencrypt](Dockerfile.nginx.letsencrypt) is
the deployment version.
There is also [a self signed cert
example](Dockerfile.nginx.selfsigned) for testing and [an Apache
one](Dockerfile.nginx.selfsigned) that only serves static starbug.com
content.
Human readable comments for how to build and run the
containers are also in the Dockerfiles but the basic idea is

```
    docker build -f Dockerfile.nginx.letsencrypt -t tls.starbug.com .
```



# To Run

TODO this is where an orchestration tool will really help

```
    docker run --name tls.starbug.com_00 --net starbugnet \
    --mount source=letsencrypt,target=/etc/letsencrypt \
    --mount source=wellknown,target=/opt/starbug.com/www/.well-known \
    --mount source=starbuglogs,target=/opt/starbug.com/logs \
    --mount source=starbugbackup,target=/opt/starbug.com/backup  \
    -v /var/run/docker.sock:/tmp/docker.sock -d -p 80:80 -p 443:443 tls.starbug.com
```



# To Debug


## Check docker container

Use the docker command line to check status and logs

```
$ docker ps -a
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS                      PORTS                    NAMES

$ docker logs ss.starbug.com_00

```


## Check starbug logs


Open an interactive shell on the contianer

```

ubuntu@ip-172-31-15-156:~$ docker exec -it ca.starbug.com-00 bash
root@93469c54f8c2:~# cd /opt/starbug.com/logs/


root@93469c54f8c2:/opt/starbug.com/logs# ls
aai-access.log		       gobsui-error.log


root@93469c54f8c2:/opt/starbug.com/logs# tail -100 nginx-access.log

```


## self signed 

To test with self signed cert certs you can hack /etc/hosts to 
intercepts DNS locally.

### edit /etc/hosts

```
##
127.0.0.1       localhost
255.255.255.255 broadcasthost
::1             localhost

# nginx testing
0.0.0.0 starbug.com
0.0.0.0 www.starbug.com
0.0.0.0 aai.starbug.com
```


# To Clean Up

```
to delete all containers:  docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)
to delete all images:      docker rmi $(docker images -q)
to delete dangling images: docker rmi $(docker images -q -f dangling=true)
```
