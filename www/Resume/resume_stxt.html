<p>
	I enjoy creating new software tools and making old ones
	better.  To me that means finding the way to use the language
	to describe the problem you are trying to solve that is as
	clear to the machine that runs it as it is to the programmer
	who comes after to maintain and, hopefully, build on it.

	I like to build good test automation. It frees you to quickly
	make big changes with out fear of breaking something and not
	knowing about it until Murphy's Law tells you.

      </p>
<p>
	Most of my experience is with Python and C/C++. I have a good
	working relationship with JavaScript, Java, git, SQL languages
	(PostgreSQL and MySQL), no-SQL languages (mongo), and various
	Unix shell scripts. Examples of my code are available in my
	github repo: GitHub/lrmcfarland.

	    I joined vArmour to help extend their Distributed Security System      (DSS) to
	    support micro-segmentation of container networks.

	    I created a simple alpine-python based flask      server I called squawker.
	    This ran first in a container but later I "back ported"
	    this to a CentOS VM to test with our original product.

	    The squawkers have an API that let me POST a JSON list of
	    other squawkers to talk to each other in several
	    protocols: http, sftp, iperf3 and the ability to easily
	    add anything with a Python client.
	  
	    I created a pip package of Python      requests
	    based DSS clients to interact with the various RESTful APIs
	    in our products to support maintenance tasks, customer
	    updates and testing.

	    I combined this with pytest to script a full system test
	    setup: labeling the squawkers to match a customer
	    configuration; applying a policy that used these labels
	    to demonstrate real time policy violations on demand;
	    verified the policy was enforced correctly and clean it
	    all up at the end to be ready for the next test.

	    I added pytest-benchmarks to measure and record
	    performance for a number of test configurations.

	    I also created a set of containers to set up a standard
	    test environment for locally mounted code under
	    development.

	  

	    I wrote a set of developer how-to guides to build our test
	    setups as well as the first pass of the customer facing
	    technical documentation.

	    And generally answered questions, reviewed pull requests,
	    mentored interns and kibitzed on coding problems.

	For the SilverTail product I created a collection python tools
	to analyze and synthesize network data, from HTML log files
	to tcpdump pcap output.
	I used python libraries, like scapy, and TCP/IP tools like
	Wireshark create test data.
	The test data sets are used to debug the scoring algorithms,
	test the limits of efficacy, measure performance, support
	unit testing and create	demos.
	
	Our development environment is Agile, test driven development
	and object oriented. It is mostly in C++ and Python. I also
	implement algorithms, fix bugs and mentor developers new to
	Python.

	I created several Python daemons to support CDNetworks

	style guide (a slightly customized version of PEP8).  I
	also documented the design, wrote the user's guides and work
	closely with QA to validate the code worked as intended.

	  IronPort makes a email server appliance. For that, I

	  Service (WBRS) product used by our web appliances. I wrote
	  the functional and design specs and developed a tool kit of
	  Python/MySQL scripts to generate the reputation updates,
	  test their efficacy and debug their contents. I have
	  implemented a Python based rule weight evaluation utility
	  that applies a gradient descent algorithm to our phone home
	  data to find the optimal set of rule weights.
